# EventLibraryIn40Languages
I will be/ have created a event library for 40 diffrent programing languages.

## My goal for 2024
It has been on my mind every few days since the start of the year. What goal do I want to set for my programming journey this year?
I enjoy event driven programming, but I never really use it. I also enjoy dabbing into different programming languages on random, but I write 20% of something, then Ctrl + A and backspace.
It means that 100% of the time, I don't stick to a language long enough to learn anything before returning to the few I'm comfortable with.
So i'll build 40 event libraries* for 40 languages in 2024.

`*Note: They won't be completely flushed out and definently not production grade. Some may be more "complete" than others.`
